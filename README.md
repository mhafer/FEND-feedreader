# Project Overview

I was given a web-based applicatiothat reads RSS feeds. I have implemented tests for this site to ensure that it runs properly and performs up to standards.

## What I learned

* How to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. 
* How to test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
* How to analyze multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript

### To run the application

* git clone the repo or download it, then Ctrl+O in your browser. Navigate to your folder and open index.html
