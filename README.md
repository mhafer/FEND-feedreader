# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of 

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## What I learned

* How to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. 
* How to test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
* How to analyze multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript

### To run the application

* git clone the repo or download it, then Ctrl+O in your browser. Navigate to your folder and open index.html
